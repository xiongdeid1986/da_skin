|?SUBJECT=Warning: `COUNT` emails have just been sent by `USERNAME`|
The |USERNAME| account has just finished sending |COUNT| emails.
There could be a spammer, the account could be compromised, or just sending more emails than usual.

After some processing of the |BYTES_FILE| file, it was found that the highest sender was |TOP_SENDER|, at |TOP_SENDER_COUNT| emails.
|*if TOP_AUTH_PERCENT>"20"|
The top authenticated user was |TOP_AUTH|, at |TOP_AUTH_COUNT| emails.
This accounts for |TOP_AUTH_PERCENT|% of the emails.  The higher the value, the more likely this is the source of the emails.
An authenticated username is the user and password value used at smtp time to authenticate with exim for delivery.|*endif|
|*if TOP_HOST_PERCENT>"20"|
The top sending host was |TOP_HOST|, at |TOP_HOST_COUNT| emails (|TOP_HOST_PERCENT|%).|*endif|
|*if TOP_PATH_PERCENT>"20"|
The most common path that the messages were sent from is |TOP_PATH|, at |TOP_PATH_COUNT| emails (|TOP_PATH_PERCENT|%).
The path value may only be of use if it's pointing to that of a User's home directory.
If the path is a system path, it likely means the email was sent through smtp rather than using a script.|*endif|

This warning was generated because the |LIMIT| email threshold was hit.
